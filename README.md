A few notebooks scraping NBA data related to refereeing and L2M reports. It also includes the retrieved data as of Feb 1, 2023.

### Where is the data from?
1. NBA L2M reports retrieved from the official NBA website.

> I do not own any of this data - I simply scraped it from the NBA website. 

#### Ideas (Submit a Git Issue if you have an idea of your own):
1. Which team has benefitted the most from erroneous mistakes?
2. Which team has the greatest delta in errors in favor vs harmful errors?
3. Consider the impact specific referees have in officiating errors?
4. Tie in betting lines to see how errors influence covers for bets?
